🚀 Python Parallel Text Handling Processor
📌 Project Overview

The Python Parallel Text Handling Processor is a scalable and lightweight text-processing system designed to efficiently handle large volumes of textual data using Python’s parallel execution capabilities.

Instead of processing text sequentially, the system divides large text files into smaller chunks and processes them simultaneously using multiprocessing. This significantly improves performance, scalability, and execution speed.

The project integrates parallel processing, rule-based text analysis, structured database storage, and search functionality into a single streamlined pipeline.
